# Condo-Selection

**Objective:** The objective of this project is to find the best condo in Toronto that meets the specific requirements of the individual. The project aims to practice data visualizing skills using Power BI while exploring various condo options available in the city.

**Analysis Approach:** To achieve this goal, we will gather data on condos available in Toronto, including their location, price, amenities, size, and other relevant factors. Using Power BI, we will create interactive visualizations to compare and analyze the condos based on the individual's preferences and requirements.

**Data Sources:** The data for this analysis was collected from real estate listings and City of Toronto related official website.

**Visualizations:** The Power BI visualizations will include interactive maps to display the location of condos, charts to compare prices and sizes, filters to refine search results based on preferences such as amenities and proximity to specific locations, and other visual representations of key condo features.

**Expected Outcomes:** Through this analysis, we expect to identify the best condo options in Toronto that align with the individual's preferences and requirements. The interactive Power BI visualizations will enable the individual to explore and compare condo properties effectively, making informed decisions about the ideal condo to purchase.

**Significance:** The process of condo selection can be overwhelming, considering the numerous options available in a city like Toronto. By utilizing Power BI for data visualization, this project aims to streamline the condo search process, saving time and effort for the individual. The visualizations will offer valuable insights into condo features, locations, and prices, facilitating a well-informed decision-making process.

The use of Power BI in this project also serves as a valuable skill-building exercise for data visualization, which can be applied to various other analytical projects in the future.

By leveraging Power BI's capabilities, this project aims to provide a user-friendly and visually appealing condo selection experience, simplifying the process of finding the perfect condo in Toronto that meets the individual's specific requirements.
